## Proof of Work algorithms

Proof of Work algorithms implemented in Python.

It was created while learning about the Proof of Work concept and thinking about how they could be implemented.
I hope it helps you to understand how they work too. I tried to make the code as simple as possible and well documented.

## Algorithms
bxpow - BitwiseXOR Proof of Work

fhpow - FactorialHash Proof of Work

npow - Numerical Proof of Work

rhpow - RandomizedHash Proof of Work

spow - Simple Proof of Work

mspow - MemoryScrypt Proof of Work

## Usage
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 *.py
```
