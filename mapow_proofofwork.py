"""
This is a memory hard proof of work algorithm. It aims to demonstrate computational effort by using a memory-intensive hashing function.
The algorithm uses the Argon2 hashing function to calculate a hash value that meets a target difficulty.
The target difficulty determines the level of computational effort required to find a valid proof.
Memory hard proof of work algorithms are designed to be resistant to ASIC-based mining and prioritize memory usage.

Algorithm Name: MemoryArgon Proof of Work (MAPoW)
